            <h3>Tuesday 5th September 2023</h3>
            At approximately 9:30am in the Dorfman Theatre last week, a big and exciting announcement was made by Mr Troen, head of Entrepreneurship at our school. It was potentially our turn to be involved in Young Enterprise.
            <br>
            <br>
            And so, 15 minutes later a group of 5 was formed. 2 more joined later to become 7. We were told that we had to pitch an idea to the judges on the 18th of September in ‘Dragon’s Den Style.’ The year group was all hyped in excitement, however getting through the first hurdle will not be easy. Indeed, only 3 teams will be given a place. Every break time between then and now did our group meet up. We discussed weird and wacky ideas. Suggestions included automatic recycling bin sorters, phone holders that stuck to your chest, and eye tracking devices that allowed hands-free navigation on your smartphone.
            <br>
            <br>
            But there’s something that we know for sure. We want to solve a problem. Whether that’s environmental issues, educational issues, cost issues or skill issues, we want to use Young Enterprise as an opportunity to help society in one way or another.

            <h3>Friday 15th September 2023</h3>

            After great deals of brainstorming and discussion over the past week, we have come up with an idea - a catalytic converter. How are we going to make it? We’re not particularly sure. However we are keen to show the judges that we have a passion for providing solutions to issues in today’s world, one step at a time. In this case, it’s an air pollution issue.
            <br>
            <br>
            Earlier at lunch, we made a few last minute edits to the presentation before finally submitting the google form! It’s quite exciting and relieving for sure and all we have to do now, is rehearse our pitch on Monday.

            <h3>Tuesday 19th September 2023</h3>

            It was during Boarder’s ‘Prep’, a 2-hour compulsory study period, where we received an email confirming a successful application to Young Enterprise.

            There’s a catch to all of this though. We have to merge with another group, HydroFlow. Their group is predominantly boarders and many of them we are friends with. Overall we look forward to seeing whether this will go well or not. We are hopeful though.

        <article><h3>Wednesday 1st November 2023 - Enlai</h3>In our journey through the Young Enterprise program, our recent interaction with Company Connect proved enlightening and productive. During this meeting, we delved deeper into the program's framework and regulations, gaining valuable insights into how to navigate its intricacies effectively.</article>

            <h3>Wednesday 8th November 2023 - Mingyo</h3>As usual, we all met on a Wednesday afternoon to discuss our ideas. We were confident about making a maths game, but the rest of the concept was as blurry as the sky on a cold wet night in Stoke. Ideas flew across the room - I suggested a board game with figurines because I believed that physical parts children can touch can increase attention span and make the game more interesting - stimulating the hand muscles which are linked to brain activities. However, when we looked into the pricings, especially with the ban on Chinese products in mind, the hopes of having physical parts slowly, gradually, faded.
            <br>
            <br>
            Instead, we decided to focus on a card game with higher quality questions. The ideas were still not unified though with various concepts from a battle-like system like pokemon trading card games to halli-galli style time limiting games or even mystery game where players cooperate to solve a big question. We decided to brainstorm some example questions with the card game as a base and figure out which rule would work best as we make the questions and play-test it.

        <article><h3>Wednesday 15th November 2023 - Yohan</h3>⁤Amidst the lively atmosphere of the SPGS fair, we distinguished ourselves with an interactive game that sparked excitement at the fair. ⁤⁤Our team invested creativity and effort into designing a game that not only provided entertainment but also allowed us to have the monetary gains required for the development of our card game.</article>
        <article><h3>Saturday 18th November 2023, Evening - Ryan</h3>It was a hectic week before the fair. We had been passionately brainstorming ideas for what our stall could be all week. However, due to changes in information concerning the fair, we had only finalised the game for the stall a few days before the fair. Due to unfortunate clashes from lunchtime commitments, time available to plan and prepare the game was scarce. I bought the prizes on Thursday afternoon in a hurry in order to get the ball rolling. On Friday, thankfully myself and a fellow team member had time to test out the physics of the game and so with an idea of the operation of the game. My team member and I, once again, headed to buy additional supplies for the fair. Despite the late arrival back to the boarding house, it was ultimately too late in the evening to prepare the equipment the night before and so waited until Saturday morning, literally hours before the fair to get going. With some luck (as well as thanks to the boarding house captain), we were able to get everything done and move the prizes and equipment to SPGS to get the stall up and ready for business. In a few hours the fair will start, and we will keep you updated regarding how it goes. </article>

            <h3>Saturday 18th November 2023, Evening - Jacob</h3>We stood there at our stall and it seemed like it wouldn’t go very well at all. Our initial tactic to try to get customers was to scream “Very fun game! Guaranteed prizes! Very cool plushies!”
            <br>
            <br>
            That was until we started approaching people individually asking if they’d be interested. A line we quite often used was “On a scale of one to ten, how good are you at aiming?” which would then lead to encouraging them to take part in the game. The sales tactic that proved most successful however was focusing on the demographic who would be most interested in our stall. We had bubble tea plushies on offer, and therefore approaching people who held bubble teas in their hands or just leaving the bubble tea stand would be the target market. Many did win prizes, but we were making profit. In the SPGS fair, there was a system of tokens where one token was equivalent to one sterling, and we had 100 of these tokens in our cashbox after the first 60 minutes. We had broken even in the first hour.
            <br>
            <br>
            The fair was a total of 4 hours, and we are fairly confident that it counts up to approximately 400 tokens, which is amazing. This does not even include the 25 Christmas cards that we plan to sell tomorrow at St Paul’s Juniors. “Christmas Cards??” you may ask. Well, two nights ago the fundraising team decided to order 25 Christmas Cards. These christmas cards have digital drawings of the school on them. We also ordered compostable bags around it. We paid 6p each for these, and for that low price it allowed the perceived value of the card to be much more than what it would be without.
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyways, it’s been an incredibly tiring day for the 6 members of the team who were there for the full 4 hours or for half of it.

        <article><h3>Wednesday 22nd November - Chris</h3>It’s been a really productive week, everyone on the team is putting in a good effort as we restock our Christmas card collection and finish off a big final flurry of fundraising work before Christmas break. Perhaps more importantly, we’ve welcomed a new member to the team, Rufus! He’ll be joining the R&D team as that will become the key focus of the company for the next couple of months. We chose him for his eagerness, willingness to learn and kind personality, so we threw a mini welcome party for him, and then explained his role and our exciting plans for the future!</article>
        <article><h3>Wednesday 29th November 2023 - Bad news about the fair</h3></article>
        <article>
            <h3>30th November 2023 - Adam Sales Director</h3>On Thursday, our school play was running, so Jacob and I thought that it would be a great opportunity to sell some Christmas cards. We stood outside the doors to the theatre trying to get rid of as many cards as possible, and they were selling quickly. Jacob and I approached parents and teachers individually, as we found that that was the most effective, although it was the most tiring and, initially, nerve-wracking. It’s currently winter, and it was close to 0°C outside, but we have to get rid of these cards before Christmas comes around, so we were outside for just over an hour. In the end, the drama department took pity on us, and since there were some seats inside that were no-show, they allowed us to watch the play. It was a satisfying end to an exhausting evening.
            <br><br>
            Overall we had made £150 in revenue from the night. This meant that the £100 cost of purchasing these cards was now negated, and every single card sold from henceforth would be pure profit, save transaction fees.

            <h3>Monday 4th December 2023 - Mingyo</h3>
            Today’s event was the pitch to the panel event where we explained about our product to the professional panel at Arrow Global. Admittedly, our pitch presentation and script was slightly rushed to say the least, but I believed that our confidence and integrity on our product can get us through.
            <br><br>
            We hit obstacles before the event even began as I was dragging a large suitcase through central London since I was going back to the boarding house in my school from home. That turned out to be the least of our worries since when me and Jacob arrived at Arrow Global, we realised 3 of our team of 5 - Chris, Alex, and Adam - were not even near the place. Apparently, there was a miscommunication leading to some missing the train, then the District Line was severely delayed.
            <br><br>
            It became very quickly apparent that the 3 would not make it in time. Me and Jacob had to do it ourselves.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, we used the slides we made and calmly delivered our pitch. We touched the details required to the panels, making our product interesting and attracting investment. Ironically, the main fault of our pitch for our maths game was not having enough numbers.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the presentation, the other 3 finally showed up. It was rather ironic, comical with various obstacles getting in our way, but we managed to find a way through, ending the day at Nando’s for a true corporate style party.

            <h3>
                Wednesday 13th December 2023 - Aneesh, R&D Team Member
            </h3>At last, what I would call an exhausting yet enjoyably stimulating hour is now over. Half of our questions have been created, ready for a thorough check and, hopefully, an approval! Of course, I am fully aware that the questions we have created will not be the finalised versions that will bring simultaneous entertainment and educational growth to our customers once our product is released, but I feel a wave of pride and accomplishment, having achieved this significant milestone. A lot of careful thought, design, and planning have gone into the 25 questions we just finished creating, as well as coming up with creative and interesting pop-culture references, which will hopefully address our target market appropriately.
            <br><br>
            While creating these questions, we combined simple mathematical logic with entertaining references and jokes, in order to achieve the enhancement of the problems - who wants cards with regular exam questions on them? For example, we made a Christmas-themed question, in which Santa was running late, and had to divide his remaining gifts between a number of children, as well as a harder question in which there is a virus that replicates itself once every few seconds, forming an introductory link to exponents.
            <br><br>
            In terms of the process of creating the questions itself, one of the key techniques used was reverse-engineering; we started off with the final answer, and worked our way backwards to determine a set of possible questions that could lead to said answer. Furthermore, it is important to note that this process not only enabled us to progress as a business, but also engaged our brains, forcing us to move out of our comfort zone and be creative, as well as analytical, since we selected the best questions that seemed to have the highest practicality and the least likelihood to cause confusion or other unforeseen problems. Overall, the experience was highly delightful, and we hope that we will successfully be able to share our passion for maths and enable other children to rapidly progress through our questions.

        <article><h3>20th December 2023 (REMEDY) - James</h3>The first week of the Christmas holidays provided a slight break from the action, however with internal deadlines on the horizon there was little time to stop. Despite the lack of an in-person meeting, digital communication proved key as our team finalised the company logo, accompanied by our catchy slogan “defeating the education gap”. Along with this, our R&D team worked towards creating a set of rules for the game, off the back of our successful test play with SPJ students. Finally, we began an employee of the month scheme, encouraging the dedication of team members towards our common goal. </article>

            <h3>Wednesday 10th January 2024 - Alex</h3>It was the first day back at school and we took this opportunity to take our team photos which you can find on the front page of our website. However, we think this isn’t the best photo and therefore we will take a new whole-team photo another time.
