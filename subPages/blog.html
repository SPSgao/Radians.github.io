            <h3>Blog Entry 1: Inception of Radians</h3>
            We were originally two groups which passed an inschool selection for young Enterprise, but to amass our prowess, we combine the teams for the potential to reach higher.
            <br>
            <br>
            As we embarked on this unified path, our first focus was on building a strong foundation. Embracing the diversity within our collective, we recognized and respected the unique strengths of each member.
            This laid the groundwork for a resilient and united team, where individual skills seamlessly complemented one another.
            <br>
            <br>
            The merger not only brought together different individuals but also injected fresh perspectives into our entrepreneurial endeavors.
            This collaborative innovation resulted in a more dynamic and creative environment.
            As we blended the best ideas and practices from both groups, one idea came on top - an approachable math game!

            <h3>Blog Entry 2: Fundraising</h3>

            All of the team have bought 20+ shares for the starting of the compnay. And with that intial funding, our further fundraising campaign started.
            <br><br>
            With the help of the whole team, we have decide and develope a game, which involves the player throwing a ping-pong ball, across a table, into three cans at the
            end. The player can at maximum bounce the ball twice on the table, and by getting it in, the player can win from a bags of candy to giant plushies. This game requires both hand eye coordinates, 3D trajectory caculation and analytical thinking to suceed.


            <br><br>We have also made christmas cards, with it's elegent design and dedicated hard work and the application of effective sales techniques, we managed to sell lots of them.
            <br><br>
